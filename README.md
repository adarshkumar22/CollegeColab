## Problem Statement
There are numerous governmental and non-governmental sources of grants available for researchers in colleges and universities. However, a lack of centralized information on the institutions that provide funding, the criteria used to select recipients, the terms and conditions of the grants, their duration, the intended purpose of the funds, the application deadlines, and the eligibility criteria for all grants available at the international, national, and local levels, as well as subject-specific details, is hindering many potential researchers from accessing these funds for their research projects. Creating a platform that provides this information would be beneficial in fostering healthy competition among researchers and ensuring optimal use of funds for research programs.

The driving idea behind this project is to raise awareness and simplify the process for researchers to access comprehensive information on all available grants in one place. Often, organizations that offer financial support struggle to identify suitable candidates due to a lack of publicity and outreach. Conversely, many aspiring researchers are unaware of these organizations and miss out on opportunities to secure funding for their projects. By creating a centralized platform, we aim to bridge this gap and connect organizations with potential recipients, while also empowering researchers by providing them with easy access to information on available grants.
 	
## Proposed solution
The concept behind this software is to create a platform where individuals interested in conducting research can easily find relevant grants to suit their interests. Additionally, users can write blogs, participate in discussion forums with experienced researchers, and search for potential collaborators through our project-sharing feature. To ensure the success of each collaboration, users can track the progress of their projects by marking them as completed or not. This platform aims to foster a community of researchers, providing a space for discussion, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing that will benefit both individual researchers and the broader research community.

## To get started with this web application, please follow these steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
3. Run the following commands in sequence:
   - npm i (to install the necessary packages)
   - npm start (to start the server)
   - cd client (to navigate to the client directory)
   - npm i (to install the necessary packages for the client)
   - npm start (to start the client server)
   
The web application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open it by entering the appropriate URL in your browser.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and run the web application on your local machine.

## Technologies used
The technologies utilized for this project include MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS, commonly referred to as the MERN stack.

## To Do Ideas
1. Create a profile page to create a healthy competition.
   - Number of posts
   - Number of projects completed
   - Share resume
   - Bio
2. Add deadline in the post such that you can tell weather it is active or not.
