## To Do Ideas
1. Create a profile page like leetcode to create a healthy competition.
   - Number of posts
   - Number of projects completed
   - Share resume
   - Bio
2. Add deadline in the post such that you can tell weather it is active or not.
3. Add a project completed in the option. It will show in profile as number of completed projects.
